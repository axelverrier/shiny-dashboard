# Shiny Dashboard  

This is a dashboard made out of RShiny, with the library bslit.  
The dashboard allows to perform an interactive analysis of the _wage1_ dataset from the wooldridge package (from _Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach_, by Jeffrey Wooldridge). 
The goal in this project was to learn and practice Shiny and bslit, as well as experimenting with data visualisation and reminding me of econometrics. 
  
In future version of the project, you might find
- a live version posted on shinyapps.io ; 
- some new analytics features (mca, regressions...). 

Feel free to come back and check later.
